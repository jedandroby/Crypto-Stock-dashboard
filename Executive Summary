Our financial technology website aims to improve the process of predicting the price of assets for traders, consumers, and companies. We have now expanded our platform to include additional machine learning and artificial intelligence models such as Prophet models, LSTM and linear regression models, as well as an automatic backtesting strategy. These models provide a more comprehensive approach to asset price prediction, allowing users to make better-informed decisions.

Users can access our platform to predict the price of assets and backtest strategies using a variety of models. The platform also includes the ability to view key metrics such as variance, compounded annual growth rate, and standard deviation. These metrics provide users with valuable insights into the performance of an asset, allowing them to better evaluate its potential for returns.

In addition to these features, our platform also includes an automatic trading backtester. This allows users to test and evaluate their trading strategies using historical data, providing them with a deeper understanding of their potential performance in real-world scenarios. The user no longer needs to manually check when conditions are met and backtest the strategy, and they can now just adjust the parameters and the website will do it automatically for them

We believe that this platform will be a valuable tool in the financial technology space. The ability to predict the price of assets and backtest strategies using a variety of models and metrics provides traders, consumers, and companies with a more comprehensive approach to making investment decisions. It can be used by both novice and experienced investors, as well as by financial institutions, to gain valuable insights into the performance of an asset. This can help them to make better-informed decisions and potentially increase their return on investment.

In summary, our platform is a comprehensive solution for predicting the price of assets and backtesting strategies. It includes machine learning and artificial intelligence models, key metrics, and an automatic trading backtester.
