Cleaned up the github repo, created workflow updates directory and dashboard testing directory. Cleaned up the readme file after alex, zach, and kaio worked on it. 
Added some extra questions and points in the breakdown of tasks. Did research into various API'S trying to find limitations and differences between them so we 
can find the API that would work best for our needs. Looked into github to try and make it so that everyone can create pull requests and merge 
them to the mainchain. (Still need to figure this out. looks like it should be possible?)

github with him 
Worked with zach,kaio, and alex, tried using einblick for working on code together, wrote functions for getting BTC data in from ccxt
