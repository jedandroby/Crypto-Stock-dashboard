# Crypto-Stock-dashboard
Project 1 for Fintech bootcamp through UC Berkeley. 

Creating a dashboard for analyzing trading strategies with 5 different strategies, on the top 5 different Crypto Tokens excluding stablecoins. 
Running same strategies on SPY and NASDAQ 100 to show comparison to trad-fi market. 
Running analysis to use results on assets to use results for running Monte carlo simulations on the trading strategies.
getting Sharpe ratio/beta/cov along with SUM stats. 

send out email as well with results(?) - optional ? 
download results?? excel, csv, database? 

Using panels for the dashboard. 

## Execution Strategy

  1 - Get Data - Robin, Alex
     - What API or APIs are we using?
     - What types of data should we look for?
     - What time frames are we looking for?
  
  2- clean data - Kaio, Zach
     - What metrics are important to keep and which ones arent?
     - We should map out the trading strategies we are using this way understand how we best want to clean the data.
   
   3- analyze data Zach, Robin
    - Identifying trends, analyzing patterns, and sorting the correct data in the right dataframes
    - We will get a better sense of how to analyze the data dependent upon the trading strategies we are using
   
   4- strategies/simulations on data - Zach, Robin, Alex, Kaio
    - Monte Carlo Simulation - 
    - Finding the Sharpe Ratio and beta
    - Covariance from crypto assets to stock market
    - Sumarry statistics, 95% range
    - implement the trading strategy conditions 
    
   5- metrics from strategies - Alex, Kaio 
    
   6 visualize data - Zach, Kaio
    - plot the monte carlo simulation, 95% ranges
    - plot covariance
    - plot share ratio and beta
    - any other plots we think are important
    
    
   8- export data -how user wants? - Alex, Robin
    - sending an email?
    - Create a csv file with all of the simulations that were run?
    - Should we showcase the results on the dashboard, or just send an email back to them?
    - Create an option for user to pick - email, csv, pdf, etc??
    
   9 -bug fixing :D - All hands on Deck!
