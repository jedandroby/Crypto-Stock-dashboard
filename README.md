# Crypto-Stock-dashboard
Project 1 for Fintech bootcamp through UC Berkeley. 

We are creating a dashboard for analyzing trading strategies with 5 different strategies, on the top 5 different Crypto Tokens excluding stablecoins. We will be running the same strategies on SPY and NASDAQ 100 to show comparison to trad-fi market. We also will run analysis to use results on assets to use results for running Monte carlo simulations on the trading strategies.Then we will be getting the Sharpe ratio/beta/cov along with SUM stats, and will be promting the user with how they want to get their results, ex. email, csv file, etc. Another way to think of this dashboard, is as an automatic trading backetesting application.


## Execution Strategy

  1 - Get Data - Robin, Alex
     - What API or APIs are we using?
     - What types of data should we look for?
     - What time frames are we looking for?
  
  2- clean data - Kaio, Zach
     - What metrics are important to keep and which ones arent?
     - We should map out the trading strategies we are using this way understand how we best want to clean the data.
   
   3- analyze data Zach, Robin
    - Identifying trends, analyzing patterns, and sorting the correct data in the right dataframes
    - We will get a better sense of how to analyze the data dependent upon the trading strategies we are using
   
   4- strategies/simulations on data - Zach, Robin, Alex, Kaio
    - Monte Carlo Simulation - 
    - Finding the Sharpe Ratio and beta
    - Covariance from crypto assets to stock market
    - Sumarry statistics, 95% range
    - implement the trading strategy conditions 
    
   5- metrics from strategies - Alex, Kaio 
    
   6- visualize data - Zach, Kaio
    - plot the monte carlo simulation, 95% ranges
    - plot covariance
    - plot share ratio and beta
    - any other plots we think are important
    
    
   7- export data -how user wants? - Alex, Robin
    - sending an email?
    - Create a csv file with all of the simulations that were run?
    - Should we showcase the results on the dashboard, or just send an email back to them?
    - Create an option for user to pick - email, csv, pdf, etc??
    
   8 -bug fixing :D - All hands on Deck!
